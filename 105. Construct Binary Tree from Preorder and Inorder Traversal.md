# 105. Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal

Given two integer arrays `preorder` and `inorder` where `preorder` is the preorder traversal of a binary tree and `inorder` is the inorder traversal of the same tree, construct and return _the binary tree_.

preorder: left -> center -> right
inorder: center-> left-> right

honestly, inorder alone probably helps the constructino fo the bst, because we know the root node and can insert the rest of the elements by beginning at the top of the tree node.
