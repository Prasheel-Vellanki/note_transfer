# LC. 701. Insert into a Binary Search Tree
You are given the `root` node of a binary search tree (BST) and a `value` to insert into the tree. Return _the root node of the BST after the insertion_. It is **guaranteed** that the new value does not exist in the original BST.

**Notice** that there may exist multiple valid ways for the insertion, as long as the tree remains a BST after insertion. You can return **any of them**.

> recall, a BST typically has any values less than or equal to the parent node to the *left* while any values greater than lie on the right.
>  **insert** does not mean we have to reorganize

**pseudocode**
do pre-order to know the inserting node's direction relative to the parent node.
At any point when a leaf node is reached, we can insert the value as one of the two children

only move when the node actually exists (no nulls as arguments to the recursive function) since we have to insert the node as a child.

we have to maintain the if/else statements since there's no early exit for this algo
```text
node = root
if val <= node.val:
	if not node.left:
		node.left = treeNode(val, Null)
	else:
		self.recur(node.left, val)
else:
	if not node.right:
		node.right = (treeNode(val, Null))
	else:
		self.recur(node.right, val)

return root
```
# Recursive
```python
def insertIntoBST(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], val: int) -> Optional[TreeNode]: 
	node = root 
	if not node: 
		return TreeNode(val) 
	if val <= node.val: 
		if not node.left: 
			node.left = TreeNode(val) 
		else: 
			self.insertIntoBST(node.left, val) 
	else: 
		if not node.right: 
			node.right = TreeNode(val) 
		else: 
			self.insertIntoBST(node.right, val) 

	return root
```
I feel like this could be a little cleaner, just b/c of the if/else statements. I also think that an Iterative approach probably exists.

## optimal
currently, we never reassign, we only assign new spots.
Instead, reassigning the sub tree doesn't change anything, but just makes the code more concise I think
```python
if not node:
	return TreeNode(val)
if val <= node.val:
	node.left = self.insertIntoBST(node.left, val)
else:
	node.right = self.insertIntoBST(node.right, val)
return root
```


# Iterative
```python
curr = root
# only fill stack if a root node exists.
while curr:
	if val <= curr.val:
		if curr.left:
			curr = curr.left
		else:
			curr.left = TreeNode(val)
			return root
	else:
		if curr.right:
			curr = curr.right
		else:
			curr.right = TreeNode(val)
			return root
# Otherwise, create the root node.	
return TreeNode(val)
```
ah, could reduce the overhead by changing the stack into a pointer, since we make a decision based on a singular node, and do not have to revisit the parent.
