# LC 450. Delete Node in a BST

Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return _the **root node reference** (possibly updated) of the BST_.

Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:

1.  Search for a node to remove.
2.  If the node is found, delete the node.

**pseudo**

1. how does key compare to node?
2. it gets really messy trying to rebalance the nodes when this happens, so we'd like the recursion function to handle the tree's organization.

rebalancing should consistently bias left, and then fallback to the right child replacing the deleted parent. 
So, three cases. The node-to-delete (ntd) will either have a left child, no left child but right child, or no children at all.

```python
# helper function to create successor for NTD in the tree
def processSubtree(root: Optional[TreeNode), key: int):
	if root.left:
		temp = root.right
		root = processSubtree(root.left)
		root.right = temp
	elif root.right:
		root = root.right
	return root
		
def deleteNode(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], key: int) -> Optional[TreeNode]:	
	if root:
		# let recursion handle the balancing, and just re-point the l/r nodes.
		if key < root.val:
			root.left = deleteNode(root.left, key)
		elif key > root.val:
			root.right = deleteNode(root.right, key)
		else:
			# NTD found, process.
			return processSubtree(root)
	return root # no matching node found OR children have been reassigned and rest of subtree stays the same.
```
		
It's important to think of terms like "predecessor" and "successor". The predecessor of a given node within a BST is the greatest valued node that lies to the left of the node. The successor is the lowest valued node that lies to the right of the node. 

In this algorithm, we must stick to one that will replace the NTD. In this case, I want to use the predecessor as the replacement for the NTD.

To do so, I want to go to the left of the NTD and grab the right most node.
If there is no left, we just grab the right child.
By definition, the predecessor will be less than the right child of NTD. Since it lies to the right of the left child, it must also be greater than all values of this sub tree. i.e, it can replace the NTD, as all values of left subtree continue to lie left, while all right values continue to lie right for the predecessor. Thus, it must suffice to replace the NTD with the predecessor, with the rest of the linkings staying the same.

```python
# Suppose we are already looking at the left subtree of NTD.
# if there is no left subtree, we can simply replace the NTD with the right child, regardless of its subtree.
def processNTD(node: TreeNode):
	if node.right:
			# go all the way right.
			return processNTD(node.right)
	else:
		return node.val
	
def deleteNode(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], key: int) -> Optional[TreeNode]:	
	if root:
		if key < root.val:
			root.left = deleteNode(root.left, key)
		elif key > root.val:
			root.right = deleteNode(root.right, key)
		else:
			if root.left:
				predecessor_val = processNTD(root.left)
				root.val = predecessor_val
				root.left = deleteNode(root.left, root.val)
			else:
				root = root.right
	return root
```

An idea presented is to recursively delete. i.e, if the predecessor is found, recursively delete it as well (which essentially replaces it with the root, overwriting the predecessor node).




we want processNTD to handle the linking logic of the subtree.
1) find the predecessor
2) replace pointer with None, so the parent no longer points to it
3) make the predecessor the root of the subtree (by changing the value of the NTD)


```python
def processNTD(node: TreeNode):
	if node.right:
			# go all the way right.
			return processNTD(node.right)
	else:
		return node.val
	
def deleteNode(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], key: int) -> Optional[TreeNode]:	
	if root:
		if key < root.val:
			root.left = deleteNode(root.left, key)
		elif key > root.val:
			root.right = deleteNode(root.right, key)
		else:
			if root.left:
				predecessor_val = processNTD(root.left)
				root.val = predecessor_val
				root.left = deleteNode(root.left, predecessor_val) # replaced with predecessor_val to make it clear that the old node is being deleted,
			else:
				root = root.right
	return root
```
the optimal solution uses the right subtree to identify the successor as the replacement node. This is because insertion patterns of BST often mean that the right tree is more balanced, which makes it the convention. It also makes more semantic sense as it "succeeds" the root node.

However, since ordered construction of a BST skews right, it means the right subtree is deeper. This satisfies my intuition that the shallowe left tree would be easier to traverse when locating the predecessor, when compared to the successor. Using the successor is just regular convention.
