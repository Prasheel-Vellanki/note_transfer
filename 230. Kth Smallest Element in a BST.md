# LC 230. Kth Smallest Element in a BST
Given the `root` of a binary search tree, and an integer `k`, return _the_ `kth` _smallest value (**1-indexed**) of all the values of the nodes in the tree_.

given that its a BST, that means we can quickly search for the smallest via dfs onto the left tree. Worst case, its the right most node, which would take O(n) time. Based on the constraints, this is fine.

-> go all the way left
-> preorder traversal, until counter hits k.

```python
res = []
def inorderTraversal(root: TreeNode):
	return (
		inorderTraversal(root.left)
		+ [root.val]
		+ inorderTraversal(root.right)
		if root else []
	)
		
return res[k]
```
I seem to struggle with the traversals, and should probably memorize how to implement them, instead of back-referencing the stuff...

```python
def kthSmallest(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], k: int) -> int: 
	
	counter = [0] 
	def inOrder(root: TreeNode): 
	if root.left: 
		res = inOrder(root.left) 
		if res is not None: 
			return res 
			counter[0] += 1 
		if counter[0] == k: 
			return root.val 
		if root.right: 
			res = inOrder(root.right) 
		if res is not None: 
			return res 
	res = inOrder(root) 
	return res
```
Really messy implementation, but the early exit makes it the canonical approach for it.

Need to make this cleaner bc how many if statements does one need bruh

```python
def kthSmallest(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], k: int) -> int: 
	self.counter = 0
	self.res = None
	def inorderTraversal(root):
		if not root or self.res is not None:
		# skip invalid nodes, skip if res is found.
			return
		inorderTraversal(root.left)
		self.counter += 1
		if self.counter == k:
			self.res = root.val
			return
		inorderTraversal(root.right)
	inorderTraversal(root)
	return self.res
```
# Iterative Approach
-> for any node, we need to check left first. once left is checked, we process the current node and then the right node.'

```python
def kthSmallest(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], k: int) -> int:
	stack = []
	counter = 0
	while stack or root:
		# Step 1: Go all the way left.
		while root:
			stack.append(root)
			root = root.left
		# Step 2: left leaf node is at top of stack.
		root = stack.pop()
		# Step 3: Process and check condition
		counter += 1
		if counter == k:
			return root.val
		# Step 4: Go right, automatically handled.
		root = root.right
```
ah, smart thing to do is to not have a counter, since when k hits 0, we know we've tallied the correct number of elements.

```python
stack = []
while stack or root:
	while root:
		stack.append(root)
		root = root.left
	root = stack.pop()
	k -= 1
	if k == 0:
		return root.val
	root = root.right
```
This just simplifies the counter logic, but is otherwise the same.
